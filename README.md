Inventory Management System

- This is a simple Python program that manages inventory of items.
- The system has four main functionalities:
-   1. Add an Item.
    2. View Items.
    3. Update Item.
    4. Delete an Item.

 - This system is designed as a result of working on exercise I got from ChatGPT.
